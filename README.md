### Building my project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. I initialize the project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo made it easier for me to share my code with the community in case I needed help.
2. I configured my repository to publish my code to a web address. This will also be useful if I needed some help during a challenge as I could share the URL for my project with my repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. I looked through the designs to start planning out how I'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help me think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, I structured my content with HTML. Writing my HTML first can help focus my attention on creating well-structured content.
5. I wrote out the base styles for my project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. I started by adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once I was happy I've completed the area I'm working on.

### Continued development
I would want to focus more on creating a neat HTML Semantic Markups. Writing the right markup can help CSS styling easy and fast.

### Deploying my project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host projects for free. My recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
You can host your site using one of these solutions
